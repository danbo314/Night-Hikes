            <!--<p id="bio">Night Hikes is <b>Olivia Godby</b> and <b>Matthew Farrell</b>. Having become friends in college, the two started writing music in the fall of 2015. They were quickly embraced by the South Bend music scene, playing a number of local venues and house shows. In the summer of 2016, the band moved to California to begin work on their first album. Their sound incorporates lush harmonies with spaced­out synths and ambient guitars.</p>-->
            <p class="bio">Night Hikes began in a garage on an autumn day in northern Indiana. <b>Olivia Godby</b> and <b>Matthew Farrell</b> met their first year at Notre Dame, only to discover a vivid musical connection as seniors. After spending 2016’s winter writing music, they went on to play a number of underground shows with local rap collective Trybe and to perform in South Bend’s festival Riverlights. Upon graduating, the duo moved to Southern California to begin work on their debut LP. Their music flickers on the cusp of the inner and outer worlds, navigating the tensions of wanting to be very much a spectator and a participant at the same time.</p>
            <p class="bio">The Blue Hour was self-recorded during summer in a 1950s era San Diego home. Inspired by a visit to Paris, the title evokes the magic of late dusk and a fascination with the transition of natural light throughout the day. New York City based artist and engineer Rusty Santos provided the mix, using leftover static and crunch to contribute a lo fi quality reminiscent of the band Broadcast. Beach House and Phantogram are also good references, as waves of distant guitars and dense vocals are anchored by a metallic synth bass and punching drums. Broken and abrupt by intent, The Blue Hour approaches clarity then recedes, preferring instead the spiritual haze of slipping into a lucid dream.</p>
